    summary: |
      Unraveling a path of Applied Scientific Research...
      
      Completed: Short-term Internship at the Queen's University, Ontario, Canada, under the  supervision of the Ph.D. Julian Ortiz. The work is oriented to apply the proposed optimal adaptive sampling methodolgy to advanced sampling for short term planning in mining industry.
      
      Research work at [IDS-Lab](http://www.ids.uchile.cl/). I worked on image restoration/reconstruction techniques by sparse regularization techniques such as Compressed Sensing, Dantzig Selector and BPDN. I focused specifically at incorporating spatial correlations by experimental covariance matrices. Next to the master student, Thomas Peet Moraga, we worked together on theoretical formulation and experimental analysis of Optimal Well Placement related to the best way of distributing measurements. This work was part of a research project focused on the optimization of sensing/locating resources in areas of mining and drilling. This work aims at obtaining the optimal positions to effect a preset amount of available measurements. Geostatistical and theoretical information tools have contextualized. These works are part of the FONDECYT 1140840 project.
      
      Research work in [SCIAN-Lab](www.scian.cl), [Leo-Lab](http://www.ontogenesis.cl/), and [BNI](http://www.bni.cl/), at Medicine Fac., U. Chile.
      Scian-Lab: Work in SOFI microscopy and the characterization of Qdots by spectrum analysis of blinking curves,
      Leo-Lab: I developed a mathematical model to describe the collective migration and guidance processes for Kupffer vesicle formation in Zebra Fish. These works are part of FONDECYT 1120558 project.
      
      Teaching: Professor at Master course: Image and biosignal processing II (Medicine Fac., U. Chile). (Co)-localization Theory: (Super)-Resolution and Overlapping/Colocalization. Super-resolution optical imaging fluctuation (Hand-on Activity).
      
      Coding on IDL, Matlab, C++, Objective C, Swift, Python, .Net, HPC Matlab PCT, CUDA, MPI
